Expanded Alternate Gamemode: "Galaxy War" (Player vs AI)
Overview
"Galaxy War" is a strategic and immersive campaign mode where players lead their chosen team across multiple Star Wars planets. With a starting budget of $40, players must manage resources, build a persistent roster, and make tactical decisions in a dynamic and evolving galaxy-wide conflict. Success depends on clever resource management, strategic use of reinforcements, and adapting to diverse planetary challenges.

Core Features
1. Persistent Battle Campaigns
Battle Outcomes Influence Progress:

Winning a battle provides significant advantages in subsequent missions, such as:
Gaining fortified positions, reinforcements, or resource boosts.
Capturing enemy leaders who provide unique abilities or intelligence for future missions.
Losing a battle weakens your position:
Retreat to less advantageous locations with fewer reinforcements.
Risk losing captured planets and bonuses.
Cumulative Damage System:

Units that survive battles carry over injuries or depleted resources to the next.
Players must choose whether to heal, repair, or replace damaged units.
2. Resource Management
Limited Resources:

Earn credits and salvage after each battle to:
Repair injured units or droids.
Upgrade weapons and armor.
Recruit new units or hire mercenaries (e.g., bounty hunters, pirates).
Upgrade Paths:

Example: Upgrade Jawas to specialize in scavenging more valuable resources or turn them into sabotage specialists.
Enhance elite units like Darth Vader with custom perks (e.g., increased durability or new abilities like “Force Crush”).
Unit Specialization:

Invest resources to specialize units for specific tasks:
Turn Stormtroopers into Mortar Troopers for area denial.
Train Rebel Troopers in guerrilla tactics for ambushes.
3. Territory Control
Planetary Bonuses:

Control iconic planets across the Star Wars galaxy, with each offering unique strategic benefits:
Kashyyyk: Wookies gain extra health and melee damage; forests provide stealth bonuses.
Tatooine: Jawas scavenge more resources, and battles feature dangerous neutral threats like Tusken Raiders.
Hoth: Cold weather weakens units without environmental protection; Tauntauns provide mobility for Rebel units.
Dynamic Galaxy Map:

Battles occur across a connected galaxy map where players choose which territories to attack or defend.
Losing a planet removes its bonus, forcing strategic prioritization.
4. Special Objectives
Dynamic Mission Types:

Missions diversify gameplay beyond simple elimination:
Capture the Flag: Retrieve a critical objective from the enemy team while defending your own.
Escort Missions: Protect fragile units (e.g., R2-D2, C-3PO) as they move across hostile terrain.
Wave Defense: Survive against escalating enemy reinforcements while holding a key position.
Mission Scaling:

Objectives scale in difficulty as the campaign progresses, introducing stronger AI enemies, environmental hazards, or multi-objective scenarios.
5. Interactive Skill Mini-Games
Droid Slicing:

Units like Chopper, R2-D2, or IG-11 engage in hacking mini-games to disable enemy droids, open doors, or disrupt shields.
Players participate in skill-check puzzles with increasing difficulty based on the importance of the task.
Force Duels:

When Force-sensitive characters clash, players engage in a turn-based mini-game:
Select tactical moves (e.g., Force push, saber strike, block) to influence the outcome.
Duels affect the morale of nearby units, with the winner inspiring allies or demoralizing enemies.
Gameplay Flow
Initial Setup:

Players start with a $40 budget to draft their team.
Choose a starting planet based on strategic value or terrain advantage.
Strategic Galaxy Map:

Players navigate a galaxy map with marked planets.
Select battles based on risk/reward, balancing potential gains against enemy strength.
Resource Management Phase:

After each battle, players:
Allocate credits to repair, upgrade, or recruit units.
Decide whether to rest units or push forward with depleted resources.
Manage captured bonuses (e.g., new units unlocked by controlling specific planets).
Battle Phase:

Engage in various mission types with unique objectives and hazards.
Use planetary terrain and team synergies to maximize effectiveness.
Evolving Challenges:

Enemy AI strengthens with each battle, introducing tougher units and new tactics.
Neutral factions (e.g., Tusken Raiders, Krykna spiders) may intervene unpredictably.
Campaign Victory:

Players win by capturing a majority of the galaxy or completing a climactic “final battle” mission against a powerful enemy force.
Advanced Features
Dynamic Enemy Commanders:
AI-controlled enemy teams feature iconic leaders (e.g., Grand Admiral Thrawn, General Grievous) with distinct strategies:
Thrawn: Prefers long-term planning, deploying reinforcements strategically.
Grievous: Leads aggressive melee-based assaults with droids.
Random Events:
Periodic galactic events shake up the campaign:
Smuggler’s Assistance: Gain bonus resources for bribing smugglers.
Imperial Blockade: Restricts movement between planets until a blockade mission is completed.
Replayability:
Multiple starting points and randomized events make every campaign unique.
Difficulty settings allow casual players to enjoy while challenging veterans with hardcore mode.
